Calculators...i frickin hate them.
**SO** we coded perfect solution.
# How anticalc works?
It works when a calculator is opened.When its open,a messagebox appears
and says you are banned.Then the app is taskkilled and some cool music
plays.
# Why this isn't a exe?
Because my dumbass couldn't figure this.
I think you should install psutil in order to work flawlessly.
